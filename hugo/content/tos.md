These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Open Collaboration Tools service (the “Service”), provided by [TypeFox GmbH](https://www.typefox.io/) (“TypeFox”). By accessing, browsing, or using this Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms. The terms “you” and “your” refer to the individual accessing the Service, as well as any entity on whose behalf such individual is acting.

TypeFox offers the Service free of charge, on a voluntary basis, with the intent to demonstrate the capabilities of the Open Collaboration Tools project and to enable others to evaluate this open source software. Furthermore, TypeFox wants to support open source communities with this Service, enabling live collaboration in scenarios where code confidentiality is not an issue.

TypeFox reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the Service or these Terms at any time without notice. Your continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.

## 1. Description of the Service

The Service is designed to facilitate live collaboration scenarios, allowing users to share IDE and editor contents with others in real-time. Users can start a collaboration session as a host and invite other participants. During a collaboration session, participants can see the host’s workspace, including text selections and cursor positions, and apply changes.

The Service is intended solely for live collaboration scenarios as described above. Any use of the Service outside of these intended scenarios, including but not limited to unauthorized access to collaboration sessions, extraction of information without consent, manipulation of information without consent, or any other misuse, is strictly prohibited.

Shared Content in the context of the Service means the content of the host's IDE workspace or a single editor content, depending on how the host has initiated the collaboration session.

## 2. Restrictions on Use

You agree not to:
- Use the Service in any way that violates these Terms or any applicable law or regulation.
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to collaboration sessions or other users’ data.
- Extract, collect, or store personal data or sensitive information from collaboration sessions without explicit permission from the respective participants.
- Engage in any activity that disrupts or interferes with the Service or its operation.

## 3. Confidentiality and Content Sharing

By using the Service, you acknowledge that:
- Any Shared Content within a collaboration session is visible to all invited participants.
- TypeFox is not responsible for the confidentiality or security of the content shared by users during collaboration sessions.
- Users concerned with confidentiality should consider deploying a private instance of the Service rather than using the public instance.
- Invited participants may modify the Shared Content; such modifications might persist after the collaboration session is closed.
- It is strongly recommended to review all changes resulting from a collaboration session before executing, deploying, or making use of them in any other way.

## 4. Disclaimers

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, TYPEFOX DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. TYPEFOX MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE.

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL TYPEFOX BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM:
