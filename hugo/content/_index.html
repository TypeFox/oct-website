        <h1>The Public Open Collaboration Server</h1>
        <p>
            A public instance of the server is available with the URL <code>https://api.open-collab.tools/</code>.
            This is used as the default server in the VS Code extension and the Theia extension.
            Feel free to use the public server for any open source work, or to evaluate and test Open Collaboration Tools.
            However, we recommend all companies who wish to adopt this technology to deploy their own instance of it, secured with their existing access restrictions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Usage of the public server is bound to its <a href="/tos">Terms of Use</a>.
            Please read them carefully and use our <a href="https://github.com/TypeFox/open-collaboration-tools/discussions">Discussions</a> for any questions.
