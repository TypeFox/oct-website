    <h3 id="22-using-the-service">
        2.2. Using the Service
    </h3>
    <p>Using the Service means logging in and then creating a collaboration session or joining such a session in order
        to share document contents. When you use the Service in this way, we process the following types of personal data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Information:</strong> When you log in to the Service, we collect your name and email address.
            This information is not stored on our servers, but sent to the client (i.e. the user's IDE or web browser,
            depending on how you have accessed the Service) in the form of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token" target="_blank">JSON Web Token (JWT)</a>.
            The JWT holds your provided User Information in encrypted form.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect information about your interactions with the Service, such as User
            Information as described above, dates and times of access, and features of the Service you use, within the
            server's logging system. This Usage Data stored in the logging system can only be accessed by a small group
            of system administrators.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="23-shared-content">
        2.3. Shared Content
    </h3>
    <p>During collaboration sessions, participants share content including text selections, cursor positions, and
        proposed changes (collectively, “Shared Content”). This Shared Content is transmitted between participants
        but is not stored on our servers or elsewhere by us. When the Shared Content is transmitted between
        participants, it is encrypted in a way that we cannot access it.</p>
    <h2 id="3-use-of-personal-data">

        <li>To display a list of participants to every participant of a collaboration session.</li>
    </ul>
